    A. Omnisharp and VS Code use a debugger.
        1. step through code in states
        2. process for handling runtime and logical errors
            a. use Omnisharp on basic 13.
            b.  new porject need vscode file
                a. once filled out can go to bug button
                b. set breakpoitnon a line to pause and click in gutter
                c. buttons get to diff points play goes as normal til next breakpoint
                d. step into is go one layer into it,
                e. steop out of will let it go back to main
                f. reset
                g. steop
                h. watch allows expression to watch over
                    A) locals may change but always watching it so now it is something else or failed
