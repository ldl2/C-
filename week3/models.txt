I.  setup in candyman already allows to work...you need to insert in ViewStart and ViewIMports
	A. Microsoft.AspNetcore.Mvc.TagHelpers
		1. nneede brought in by candyman do with mine
		2.medles.  User.cs
			a. AspModels.Models <--subanmespace
			public class User
{
	public string first_name{get;set;} same last_name and location
}
			b. replace what viewbag has been doing
				A) pass
				B) FIRSTcreate a user in controller use using aspmodels.models User userguy = new user();
					1) var = string b/c string above
					2)Viewbad.User = userguy
					3) instead of viewbad on cshtml use @model (taghealper needed) AspModels.Models.User (model namespace and userobject)
						a) in function return userguy
							A. now instead of viewbag use Model. since Models.User we don't need User we returned userguy so that is @model.
							B. need model class on page but can pass to second model with both types inside of it.... model bundlin
				C) can go the other direction passing model from view to controller in form submission.
					1) take in on form and takes in name attributes
div class="form-group">
	<label for"first_name"> First Name </label>
	<input type="text" name="first_name" id="">

[httppost]
route("submit")
public Iactionresult submit(user the User)
{
	return redirect to action("Index");

}

doesn't use model but we cna submit to form and accep object

data annotation on model class

on model class
System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;

now cna put in annotations on model

[Requried]
[minLength(3)]

these are attributes which annotated what you need

this is quick valudiation

need on form page

@model AspModels.Models.user

now need attribute tages on form


not action but asp-action=method (name of class on rotuing bbut not route)
label asp-for and on input asp-for="first_name" instead of name attribute
don't neeed text on lable that comes from model!!!! null values are empty strongs now check Model

modelstate on isvalid and perform by this point


span asp-validation-for="first_name" ></span>

Display(Name="First Nmae")] does it ont he screen now

can put in custome vlaidation error with (here if other inputs, ErrorMessage="asbdksuas")]


view cna send a thing to pass "show", the User)
