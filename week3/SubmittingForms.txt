I. Submitting Forms
	A. no special front end work.  Do as HTML forms would normally
	B. Backend accepts submission
		1. caught in targeted method


Method.cshtml
<form action="method" method="post">
    <input type="text" name="TextField"/>
    <input type="number" step="1" name="NumberField"/>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

Your Controller.cs
[HttpPost]
[Route("method")]
public IActionResult Method(string TextField, int NumberField)
{
    // Do something with form input
}
		2. parameters in method must match

	C. on rendering there it is able to pass to <h1> @ViewBag.Example </h1>
		1. can also do logic here but don't make it a goal centralize on backend.
@{
    string LocalString = ViewBag.Example + " Good to see you!";
}
<h1>@LocalString</h1>
